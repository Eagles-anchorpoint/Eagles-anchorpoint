## ðŸš€ QUICK START (3 STEPS)

### Step 1: Deploy Core Platform (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Create GitHub repo
# https://github.com/new
# Name: eagles-anchorpoint-platform
# Make PUBLIC

# 2. Upload eagles-anchorpoint-core-platform.html to root

# 3. Enable GitHub Pages
# Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Source: main / root
# Your platform lives at: https://your-username.github.io/eagles-anchorpoint-platform
```

### Step 2: Add First Client (2 minutes)

Create file: `clients/acme-corp.json`

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "clientId": "acme-corp",
    "name": "ACME Corporation",
    "industry": "Technology",
    "domain": "acme-corp.com"
  },
  "brand": {
    "logo": "https://cdn.../acme-logo.svg",
    "colors": {
      "primary": "#1a1a2e",
      "accent": "#16c784",
      "highlight": "#e94560"
    }
  },
  "features": {
    "hero": true,
    "features": true,
    "pricing": true,
    "contact": true
  },
  "content": {
    "hero": {
      "title": "ACME Corporation",
      "subtitle": "Enterprise solutions"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Load Configuration (Already Built In)

The platform automatically loads client configs based on URL parameter:

```
https://your-platform.com/?client=acme-corp
â†’ Loads acme-corp.json configuration
â†’ Renders full branded site
```

**Done!** Your platform is live serving your first client. ðŸŽ‰
